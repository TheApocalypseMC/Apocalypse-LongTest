# Apocalypse-LongTest
Apocalypse-LongTest is a test we run periodically to view the performance and player analytics of our servers. The test starts as soon as the server is enabled, and ends as soon as the plugin is disabled or the server is reloaded/stopped. It prints out system and memory information to a log file 5 minutes after the test starts. Then, it records player data every hour and tells you useful information about the performance of your server.
## Compiling
After cloning the repository, enter its root directory and type '''mvn clean install'''. This will create a plugin jar file in target/Apocalypse-LongTest.jar.
